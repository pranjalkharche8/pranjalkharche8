    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Swami Vivekananda was born as
Narendranath Dutta in Calcutta on
anuary 12, 1863. His parents were
Bhuvaneshwari Devi and Vishwanath
Dutta, an attorney-at-law at the Calcutta
High Court. In 1881, as a young student
at Scottish Church College, Calcutta,
he first met the great saint and mystic,
Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886). Young Naren was
seeking G od, and whichever holy man he met,
Naren asked if he had seen G od. The answer
in m ost cases was in the negative. But, when he
asked Sri Ramakrishna the same question, thelatter affirmed that he had seen G od, just as
clearly as he saw him, or probably even better.
He added that there were means to realise G od
and if Naren followed them, he too would do
the same. It was the authenticity in this promise
o f direct experience of G od that appealed to the
intensely rational Narendranath, and he was
equally moved to see the all-encompassing love
o f the saint. Eventually, Narendranath accepted
Sri Ramakrishna as his spiritual master.
After the passing away o f Sri Ramakrishna,
Narendranath organised some of his brother
disciples and together they all took the vow
of sannyasa (renunciation and m onkhood) in
Decem ber 1886. They lived in a temporary
monastic premise at Baranagore in Calcutta.
Between 1888 and 1889, he lived there. He
also travelled to various pilgrimage centres in
North India.
        Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was one
o f the m ost distinguished spiritual leaders
o f India who took the ancient Indian message
o f Vedanta to the West and at the same time
called upon Indians to serve G o d in man.
He was not a prophet aloof from the miseries
o f the world. As a patriot-saint, he exhorted
Indians to serve India by especially working
for the economically backward sections of
society. Thus, he has left behind a dual legacy
o f spiritual awakening and national revival.
